# What's this?
We are offering a Haskell mentoring program for everyone.

When you join a group, we assign you to an appropriate mentor based on your skill level and preferences. Your mentor will track your progress, and guide your learning experience by providing exercises and reading materials.

After some time we expect you to gain enough skills so that you no longer need a mentor. Indeed, we expect you to start helping people out in the general channels and eventually become a mentor to others, but that's pretty optional.

# How can I join?
Just email Alexey Shmalko at <rasen.dubi@gmail.com> or Konstiantyn Rybnikov at <k-bx@k-bx.com> and we'll add you to Slack.

## I haven't programmed before, can I still take part?
Sure. Actually, learning Haskell is like learning programming from scratch, so you're starting out on a level similar to most others.

# I want to be a mentor, what should I do?
Great, message Alexey or Kostia and we'll discuss that.

## I'm not sure I'll be a good mentor but want to try
That's okay, we'll pair you up with another mentor to help out.

# Can I join if I don't want a mentor?
Yeah, sure. Everyone is free to participate in discussions and ask questions in the general channels.

# Other questions

## Why are you doing this?
We're in love with Haskell and want to share this love with other people.

## What languages are supported?
Our mentors speak one or more of Russian, Ukrainian, English, and Dutch.

## What are your future plans?
After getting enough mentors and skilled students we hope to start working on training projects in groups, and eventually real projects.

## I still have a question, how can I ask it?
Ask Alexey Shmalko at <rasen.dubi@gmail.com> or Konstiantyn Rybnikov at <k-bx@k-bx.com> or ask your question in #general on Slack.
